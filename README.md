Code relating to Tamagotchi Town with the aim of making it possible to build a fully-functional custom tamagotchi town server

== Dream Town ==       
cebd_decrypt - For decrypting and re-encrypting Dream Town binaries and Config files              
``    usage: cebd_decrypt.exe <mode> <input file> <output file> ``           
``  modes:``
``     -d decrypt``        
``     -e encrypt``           

--- Server Side Code ---

NOTE: This is NOT bandai's original code. it wouldnt really be possible to get that unless someone had an exploit back in the day to get the files out, rather- this is my best attempts to re-create what the server side code did.

this is the same code used on my "Tamatown Rewritten" site, https://famitama.xyz
